##Submitting Pull Requests and Issues
**Please Please Please** Submit any bugs or any fixes you would like fixed about the app. 
Since I do professional development, and personal web development projects,
I dont have as much time as I used to for my android apps,
So any help finding and squashing bugs is appreciated :)

##Building and testing
Clone the repo, and open in Android Studio :) These projects may have weird issues opening, since I've been doing
Android since the Eclipse days, things may need a little work to get everything up and running!


##License

All Assets and rights of the application are reserved to Aaron Turner (Me)

However this code is open-source and may be used to help in your own projects

P.S I don't know much about each licenses haha
